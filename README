This folder has everything that is needed for building GS Apps

Prerequires:
  To build GS Apps, one needs to install node.js, browserify, cordova and node-webkit. Please follow the sequence to install them:
  1. download node.js from http://nodejs.org and install it
  2. use the following commands to install browserify and cordova:
     sudo npm install -g browserify
     sudo npm install -g cordova
  3. download node-webkit mac version, and put node-webkit.app in the root of the folder. node-webkit 0.8.6 is tested

What is in the folder:
  1. gs_compile: compile the source files which may require some node modules or
files. The output files can be directly run on browsers
  2. gs_build: build the source file into excutable files on different platforms. Only support browser, android and mac now.
  3. www_example: example source file
  4. node_modules: all supported node modules

Requires:
  1. The entry point in the source file needs to be index.html. 
  2. All the files requiring node modules need to be .js files
  3. node modules that are not in node_modules are not supported

Usage:
  1. build Apps:
     gs_build source_file_path project_name
     It will generate gs_app_[platform] in this folder
  2. compile the code in IDE to test in browser
     gs_compile source_file_path destination_path
  3. To run the example, one needs to install the node module required by the .js file.
     To do it, in the node_module folder, run:
       npm install markdown
